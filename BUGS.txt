- passwd: ^D does not abort 3 retries, need to differentiate between abort and empty password
- pam_unix_ng(chauthtok): geteuid() check doesn't work anymore after setuid() of pwupd, test for nosetprivs like sudo
- pam_unix_ng: Add "no_root" option so that it never assumes it's called by root?
- pam_unix_ng: support PAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK
- pam_unix_ng: handle PAM_SILENT correct
- pwupd: use different PAM configs if called by root or not.
